# WORDLE - The Word's Trending Game.

WORDLE is the trending game only available on the web
`https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/`

The goal is to guess on word in 6 tries, each day.

So, I decided to build my own version on a CLI.

This script can still be improved.

So, for any suggestions, my email address: `nya.tony2010@gmail.com`

To install the requirements:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
